<p>Currently Iâ€™m pursuing job opportunities within India and the Middle East and am interested in challenging roles that offer the possibility of growth and the ability to showcase my skills. I've 5+ years of experience in procurement, logistics, sales and customer management. I've completed my Post Graduate Diploma in International Business Management from Centennial College, Toronto and B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering from SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Cochin.</p>

<p>I am open to new challenges and enthusiastic to work independently or as part of a team. I strongly believe that I can seamlessly adapt into any position having previously worked in multicultural business markets of Toronto and Muscat. I've always believed myself to be a global citizen and this attitude has helped me foster a positive and open-minded approach towards people and life as a whole.
</p>

<p>I have been credited for successfully completing projects on tight schedules and over the years, I've learned how to prioritize and delegate my tasks efficiently. I've utilized my strong communication and negotiation skills in performing various roles entrusted upon me. I always strive to maintain an innovative, logical and open-minded approach when dealing with any situation. This has helped me remain focused and solve problems efficiently. In addition, I also try to anticipate possible bottlenecks in advance and stay inquisitive to keep learning on the go.
</p>

<p>In addition to my work schedules, I also have experience in organizing events and have participated in various volunteering activities while in Canada as well as in India. In Toronto, I have volunteered for The Empire Club of Canada (ECC) in organizing talks attended by high profile guests which included heads of state and government dignitaries. In India, I have volunteered for a non-profit organization, Make A Difference (MAD), to help under-privileged children learn English in a fun and interactive manner. Moreover, I also have hands-on experience in organizing social events since my college days.
